    <!-- Description of the Game -->
    <p><strong>Game Title:</strong> Business Tycoon - Decision Maker</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this game, you take the role of a business owner making critical decisions to grow your company. Your goal is to balance three key elements: funds, employee morale, and customer satisfaction. Each decision you make will affect these areas, and your choices will determine the outcome of your business.</p>

    <!-- How to Play -->
    <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> You will be presented with different business scenarios, and for each scenario, you’ll have to make a choice between two options. Each option has a positive or negative impact on your business, affecting your funds, employee morale, and customer satisfaction. After making a decision, you’ll see the impact and an explanation, then click 'Next' to proceed to the next scenario.</p>

    <!-- Outcome -->
    <p><strong>Possible Outcome:</strong> The success or failure of your business will depend on your ability to manage your resources wisely. If your funds run too low or your employee morale and customer satisfaction dip too much, your business could face challenges. The game ends when all scenarios have been completed, and your final results will reflect how well you balanced the elements.</p>
